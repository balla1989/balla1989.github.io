          <p>
            I am Senior Utilities Engineer at WSP. Have been with WSP for four
            years now and I primarily focus on Utilities Coordination which may
            include space-proofing the utilities design in 3 dimensions to provide
            client with assurance that all the designed utilities have been
            planned with constructibility at core.
          </p>
          <p>
            I focus on digital engineering to deliver the end product to client.
            This has been a key item in the projects as clients want to visualize
            how the new design from various disciplines fit in together.

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>
            As a Utilities Engineer in wsp Utilities team, I work with clients,
            engineers and stakeholders from various interfaces specifically in
            Combined Service Route (CSR) design. I have successfully worked in
            detailed design of various landmark projects from stage 1 and nurtured
            the projects till Stage 3 and AFC stages under challenging and fast
            paced timeline. I am also involved in strategizing the
            implementation/training of Civil 3D for utilities/CSR design over the
            wider team. In addition, I am particularly interested in writing codes
            in C# .net environment using AutoCAD/Civil 3D API to expedite the
            mundane tasks and workflows.
